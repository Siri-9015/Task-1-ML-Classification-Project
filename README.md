# Dataset Features

The model uses the following features:

* Number of Dependents
* Education
* Self Employment Status
* Annual Income
* Loan Amount
* Loan Term
* CIBIL Score
* Residential Asset Value
* Commercial Asset Value
* Luxury Asset Value
* Bank Asset Value

# Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
* Streamlit deployment
* Cloud deployment using Render or Heroku
* Improved UI/UX design
* Integration with real financial datasets
* Authentication system for users

# Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of supervised machine learning techniques for loan approval prediction.

By comparing multiple classification algorithms and evaluating them using various performance metrics, the project identifies the most effective model for financial decision-making tasks.

The Flask deployment and interactive user interface further enhance the practical usability of the system.
